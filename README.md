# Video Calling App

video chat application built using python+flask in the back-end and React + WebRTC and Metered Video SDK in front-end to build a video calling application.

Our video chat application would allow users to have group video chat, with the ability to share their screen.

The application would run on all modern browsers as well iOS Safari and in Android web browser.

### What I learnt
The aim was to test my skills of working with SDK's and 3rd Party API's. 
The added challenge of integrating React and Python was really neat, it exposed me a lot but I managed to handle it.
